Create validation classes for all API endpoints:
```bash
php artisan make:request Product/StoreProductRequest

php artisan make:request Inventory/StockInRequest
php artisan make:request Inventory/StockOutRequest
php artisan make:request Inventory/StockTransferRequest
# ... etc for all endpoints
```

#### 1.2 API Resources for Response Transformation
Create resource classes for consistent API responses:
```bash
php artisan make:resource ProductResource
php artisan make:resource ProductCollection
php artisan make:resource InventoryResource
php artisan make:resource CustomerResource
# ... etc for all models
```

#### 1.3 Event Registration
Update `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php`:
```php
protected $listen = [
    ProductCreated::class => [SendProductCreatedNotification::class],
    LowStockDetected::class => [SendLowStockAlert::class],
    SystemNotification::class => [StoreNotificationInDatabase::class],
    // ... register all events and listeners
];
```

#### 1.4 Queue Configuration
Configure queue workers in `.env`:
```
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```
Create queue worker jobs:
```bash
php artisan make:job ProcessProductImport
php artisan make:job SendBulkNotifications
php artisan make:job GenerateMonthlyReport
```

#### 1.5 Middleware Registration
Update `bootstrap/app.php` to register middleware:
```php
->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
