## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

Already included in composer.json:
```bash
composer require minishlink/web-push
```

### 2. Generate VAPID Keys

```bash
php artisan webpush:generate-keys
```

Add output to `.env`:
```env
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your-generated-public-key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your-generated-private-key
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:admin@unityerp.com
```

### 3. Run Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 4. Start Queue Workers

Development:
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

Production (with Supervisor):
```bash
sudo cp backend/supervisor-queue-worker.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/unity-erp-queue.conf
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update
sudo supervisorctl start unity-erp-queue-worker:*
```

### 5. Frontend Integration

Register service worker in your Vue app:
```javascript
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/js/service-worker.js');
}
```

Request permission and subscribe:
```javascript
import { setupNotifications } from '@/utils/notifications';
await setupNotifications();
```

## Usage Examples

### Dispatching Events

```php
use App\Events\Sales\OrderCreated;

// In your service
OrderCreated::dispatch(
    orderId: $order->id,
    orderNumber: $order->order_number,
    customerId: $order->customer_id,
    customerName: $order->customer->name,
    totalAmount: $order->total_amount,
    tenantId: $tenant->id,
    userId: auth()->id()
);
```

### Sending Manual Notifications

```php
use App\Services\Notification\NotificationService;

$notificationService = app(NotificationService::class);

$notificationService->sendBulkNotification(
    userIds: [1, 2, 3],
    title: 'System Update',
    message: 'New features have been released',
    type: 'info',
    actionUrl: '/announcements/123'
);
```

### Frontend Subscription

```vue
<template>
  <button @click="enableNotifications">
    Enable Notifications
  </button>
</template>

<script>
import { setupNotifications } from '@/utils/notifications';

export default {
  methods: {
    async enableNotifications() {
      const success = await setupNotifications();
      if (success) {
        this.$toast.success('Notifications enabled!');
      }
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
