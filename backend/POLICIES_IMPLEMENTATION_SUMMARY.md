# Policy Classes Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive Policy classes for the Unity ERP SaaS Laravel backend, enforcing fine-grained RBAC/ABAC (Role-Based Access Control / Attribute-Based Access Control) with strict tenant isolation.

## Implemented Policy Classes

### 1. ProductPolicy (`app/Policies/ProductPolicy.php`)
**Purpose**: Authorization for Product model operations

**Features**:
- Tenant isolation enforcement
- Organization-level access control
- Branch-level restrictions
- Standard CRUD methods (viewAny, view, create, update, delete, restore, forceDelete)
- Super admins can manage all products in their tenant
- Branch-level users restricted to their branch products

**Key Authorization Rules**:
- Users can only access products from their tenant
- Organization matching required when applicable
- Branch matching required for branch-level users
- Only admins can force delete products

### 2. StockLedgerPolicy (`app/Policies/StockLedgerPolicy.php`)
**Purpose**: Authorization for StockLedger (inventory) operations

**Features**:
- Append-only enforcement (stock ledgers are immutable)
- Admin-only modifications for critical corrections
- Stock operation methods (stockIn, stockOut, stockAdjustment, stockTransfer)
- Branch-level restrictions

**Key Authorization Rules**:
- Stock ledger is append-only by design
- Only super admins can update entries (for corrections)
- Only admins can delete entries
- Branch users can only view their branch entries

### 3. TenantPolicy (`app/Policies/TenantPolicy.php`)
**Purpose**: Authorization for Tenant management

**Features**:
- Strict access control for tenant operations
- Super admin-only tenant creation/deletion
- Tenant admins can manage their own tenant settings

**Key Authorization Rules**:
- Only super admins can create tenants
- Users can only view/edit their own tenant (except super admins)
- Cannot delete your own tenant
- Tenant admins can update their tenant settings
- Super admins can manage any tenant

### 4. UserPolicy (`app/Policies/UserPolicy.php`)
**Purpose**: Authorization for User management

**Features**:
- Enhanced organization and branch-level restrictions
- Role hierarchy enforcement (super-admin > admin > branch-manager > user)
- Self-service restrictions (users can edit themselves)
- Role and permission assignment authorization
- Prevents privilege escalation

**Key Authorization Rules**:
- Cannot delete yourself
- Tenant isolation mandatory

### 5. OrganizationPolicy (`app/Policies/OrganizationPolicy.php`)
**Purpose**: Authorization for Organization operations

**Features**:
- Hierarchical organization support (parent-child relationships)
- Efficient recursive CTE query for ancestry checks
- Organization-level access restrictions
- Admins can manage child organizations

**Key Authorization Rules**:
- Users can view their organization and child organizations
- Cannot delete your own organization
- Admins can create/delete organizations
- Super admins have full access within tenant
- Hierarchical access control with ancestor checking

### 6. BranchPolicy (`app/Policies/BranchPolicy.php`)
**Purpose**: Authorization for Branch operations

**Features**:
- Organization and branch-level restrictions
- Branch manager support
- Settings management authorization
- User assignment authorization

**Key Authorization Rules**:
- Branches must belong to user's organization
- Cannot delete your own branch
- Branch managers can manage their branch settings
- Admins can manage branches in their organization
- User assignment requires proper authorization

## AuthServiceProvider Updates

Updated `app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php` to register all policies:

```php
protected $policies = [
    User::class => UserPolicy::class,
    Product::class => ProductPolicy::class,
    StockLedger::class => StockLedgerPolicy::class,
    Tenant::class => TenantPolicy::class,
    Organization::class => OrganizationPolicy::class,
    Branch::class => BranchPolicy::class,
];
```

## FormRequest Updates

Updated the following FormRequests to use policy-based authorization:

1. **StoreProductRequest** - Uses `ProductPolicy::create`
2. **UpdateProductRequest** - Uses `ProductPolicy::update`
3. **CalculatePriceRequest** - Uses `ProductPolicy::viewAny`
4. **StockInRequest** - Uses `StockLedgerPolicy::stockIn`
5. **StockOutRequest** - Uses `StockLedgerPolicy::stockOut`
6. **StockAdjustmentRequest** - Uses `StockLedgerPolicy::stockAdjustment`
7. **StockTransferRequest** - Uses `StockLedgerPolicy::stockTransfer`

## Authorization Hierarchy

### Role Hierarchy
```
Super Admin (tenant-wide access)
    ↓
Admin (organization-wide access)
    ↓
Branch Manager (branch-level access)
    ↓
User (limited permissions)
```

### Tenant Isolation
- **Level**: Mandatory at all levels
- **Enforcement**: All policies check `user->tenant_id === resource->tenant_id`
- **Bypass**: None - even super admins are restricted to their tenant

### Organization Restrictions
- Users with `organization_id` can only access resources in their organization
- Hierarchical access: can access child organizations
- Admins can manage their organization and descendants

### Branch Restrictions
- Users with `branch_id` can only access resources in their branch
- Branch managers can manage their branch
- Admins can manage all branches in their organization

## Key Features

### 1. Strict Type Safety
All policies use:
```php
declare(strict_types=1);
```

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation
Every method includes:
- Purpose description
- Parameter documentation with types
- Return value documentation
- Business rule explanations

### 3. Standard CRUD Methods
All policies implement:
- `viewAny(User $user): bool`
- `view(User $user, Model $model): bool`
- `create(User $user): bool`
- `update(User $user, Model $model): bool`
- `delete(User $user, Model $model): bool`
- `restore(User $user, Model $model): bool`
- `forceDelete(User $user, Model $model): bool`

### 4. Custom Authorization Methods
Additional methods for specific operations:
- **StockLedgerPolicy**: `stockIn`, `stockOut`, `stockAdjustment`, `stockTransfer`, `manage`
- **TenantPolicy**: `manageSubscription`, `viewSettings`, `updateSettings`
- **UserPolicy**: `assignRoles`, `assignPermissions`
- **BranchPolicy**: `manageSettings`, `assignUsers`

### 5. Security Best Practices
- Mandatory tenant isolation
- Role-based access control
- Prevents privilege escalation
- Self-service protections (can't delete yourself)
- Append-only enforcement for critical data

## Usage Examples

### In Controllers
```php
// Authorize viewing a product
$this->authorize('view', $product);

// Authorize creating a product
$this->authorize('create', Product::class);

// Authorize stock operation
$this->authorize('stockIn', StockLedger::class);

// Authorize tenant settings update
$this->authorize('updateSettings', $tenant);
```

### In Blade Templates
```blade
@can('update', $product)
    <!-- Show edit button -->
@endcan

@can('delete', $product)
    <!-- Show delete button -->
@endcan

@can('stockIn', App\Modules\Inventory\Models\StockLedger::class)
    <!-- Show stock in form -->
@endcan
```

### In FormRequests
```php
public function authorize(): bool
{
    return $this->user()->can('create', Product::class);
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
Create tests for each policy method:
```php
test('admin can update products in their organization')
test('branch user cannot view products from other branches')
test('super admin can delete any product in their tenant')
test('user cannot delete stock ledger entries')
test('tenant admin can manage their tenant settings')
```

### Feature Tests
Test complete authorization flows:
```php
test('product creation requires proper authorization')
test('stock transfer enforces branch restrictions')
test('tenant isolation prevents cross-tenant access')
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. OrganizationPolicy Optimization
- Uses recursive CTE query for efficient hierarchical lookups
- Prevents N+1 query problems
- Single database query for ancestry checking

### 2. Policy Caching
- Laravel automatically caches policy results per request
- No additional caching needed for authorization checks

### 3. Database Indexes
Ensure indexes exist on:
- `tenant_id` (all tables)
- `organization_id` (where applicable)
- `branch_id` (where applicable)
- `parent_id` (organizations table)

## Security Considerations

### 1. Tenant Isolation
✅ **Enforced**: All policies check tenant_id
✅ **Mandatory**: No bypass mechanism
✅ **Consistent**: Applied across all operations

### 2. Append-Only Architecture
✅ **StockLedger**: Immutable by default
✅ **Admin Override**: Only for critical corrections
✅ **Audit Trail**: All changes tracked

### 3. Role Hierarchy
✅ **Prevents Escalation**: Users can't elevate privileges
✅ **Self-Protection**: Can't delete yourself
✅ **Clear Hierarchy**: Super Admin > Admin > Branch Manager > User

### 4. Branch/Organization Restrictions
✅ **Hierarchical**: Parent access includes children
✅ **Isolated**: Siblings can't access each other
✅ **Enforced**: Checked in all operations

## Integration Points

### Spatie Permission Package
Policies integrate with Spatie Permission for:
- Role checking: `$user->hasRole('admin')`
- Permission checking: `$user->can('view-products')`
- Multiple roles: `$user->hasAnyRole(['admin', 'super-admin'])`

### Laravel Authorization
Standard Laravel authorization methods work:
- Gate facade: `Gate::allows('view', $product)`
- Controller helpers: `$this->authorize('update', $product)`
- Blade directives: `@can('delete', $product)`
- Request authorization: `$request->user()->can('create', Product::class)`

## Required Permissions
