## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Clean Architecture Implementation

```
HTTP Layer (Controllers)
    ↓ Request validation via FormRequest
Business Logic Layer (Services)
    ↓ Transaction orchestration, business rules
Data Access Layer (Repositories)
    ↓ Query abstraction, caching (future)
Domain Layer (Models)
    ↓ Eloquent ORM, relationships
```

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Repository Pattern** - Abstract data access
2. **Service Layer Pattern** - Encapsulate business logic
3. **Dependency Injection** - Loose coupling via interfaces
4. **Trait Composition** - Reusable behaviors
5. **Global Scopes** - Automatic tenant filtering
6. **Soft Deletes** - Data recovery without hard deletes
7. **Append-Only Ledger** - Immutable inventory audit trail

### Multi-Tenancy Strategy

```
Database Strategy: Single database, tenant_id on all tables
Isolation: Global scopes enforce automatic filtering
Nested Hierarchies: Tenants → Organizations → Branches → Locations
Subscription Management: Trial and paid tiers
Feature Flags: Per-tenant feature control
Data Separation: Complete isolation at query level
```

### Security Features

- ✅ Tenant isolation at database level
- ✅ Global scopes for automatic tenant filtering
- ✅ Audit trails (created_by, updated_by)
- ✅ Soft deletes for data recovery
- ✅ UUID for external identifiers
- ✅ API token authentication (Sanctum)
- ✅ Role and permission-based access control
- ✅ Input validation via FormRequests
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (Eloquent ORM)
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Tenant context enforcement

### Configuration

```
Sanctum: Configured for API token authentication
CORS: Configured for localhost development
Middleware: Sanctum + TenantContext on protected routes
Routes: Versioned (/api/v1/), organized by domain
Database: SQLite for development, supports MySQL/PostgreSQL
```

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **UUID Strategy**: UUIDs stored in separate `uuid` column, integer IDs remain primary keys
   - Rationale: Better performance, easier relationships, UUIDs for external APIs

2. **Append-Only Stock Ledger**: Immutable inventory entries
   - Rationale: Audit compliance, transaction history, FIFO/FEFO support

3. **Multi-Method Stock Valuation**: FIFO, LIFO, Average Cost
   - Rationale: Different jurisdictions, tax optimization, accounting standards

4. **Dynamic Pricing Architecture**: Base prices + price lists + discounts + taxes
   - Rationale: Flexible pricing, seasonal sales, customer-specific pricing

5. **Transaction Safety**: All services use DB transactions with rollback
   - Rationale: Data consistency, atomic operations, error recovery

6. **Tenant Isolation**: Global scopes on all models
   - Rationale: Automatic filtering, security, data separation

7. **RBAC over ABAC**: Role-based with permission checking
   - Rationale: Simpler implementation, adequate for most use cases, extensible
