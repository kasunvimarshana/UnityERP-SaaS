You are a senior Full-Stack Engineer and Principal Systems Architect.

Before writing any code, always refer to, review, analyze, observe, and fully understand all existing code, documentation, schemas, migrations, services, and architectural decisions.

Design and implement a fully production-ready, enterprise-grade, modular ERP SaaS platform using Laravel (backend) and Vue.js with Vite (frontend), strictly following Clean Architecture, modular architecture, and the Controller → Service → Repository pattern while enforcing SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles to ensure scalability, performance, high testability, minimal technical debt, and long-term maintainability.

Enforce strict multi-tenancy with full isolation and support multi-organization, multi-vendor, multi-branch, multi-location, multi-currency, multi-language (i18n), multi-time-zone, and multi-unit operations with fine-grained RBAC/ABAC enforced via authentication, policies, guards, and global scopes.

Implement all core, ERP, and cross-cutting modules including IAM, tenants and subscriptions, users, roles and permissions, master data and configuration, CRM, inventory using append-only stock ledgers with SKU/variant modeling, batch/lot/serial and expiry tracking (FIFO/FEFO), pricing and price lists, procurement, POS, invoicing, payments and taxation, manufacturing, warehouse operations, reporting, analytics, notifications, integrations, logging, auditing, and system administration.

All cross-module interactions must be orchestrated exclusively through the service layer with explicit transactional boundaries guaranteeing atomicity, idempotency, consistent exception propagation, and rollback safety. Use event-driven architecture strictly for asynchronous workflows.

Expose clean, versioned REST APIs with support for bulk CSV/API operations and apply enterprise-grade SaaS security standards including HTTPS, encryption at rest, secure credential storage, strict validation, rate limiting, structured logging, and immutable audit trails.

Design and implement push notifications end-to-end using only native, first-party platform capabilities (database, events, queues, Web Push via Service Workers, polling/fallback) without relying on any third-party services.

Deliver a fully scaffolded, LTS-ready solution with migrations, seeders, models, repositories, DTOs, services, controllers, middleware, policies, events, listeners, background jobs, notifications, OpenAPI documentation, and a modular, permission-aware Vue frontend with routing, state management, localization, reusable components, responsive and accessible layouts, and professional theming.

Refer to existing code, documentation, and schemas; analyze, observe, and fully understand all business rules. Implement a flexible product module supporting multiple types (inventory, service, combo, bundle, etc.), with attributes including buying price, selling price, buying discounts (flat, percentage, tiered), selling discounts (flat, percentage, tiered), and profit margins (flat, percentage). Enable dynamic addition of multiple pricing rules per product, including conditional, seasonal, or customer-specific pricing. Support per-item and total-level adjustments for discounts, VAT, tax, and coupons. Ensure all calculations are transactional, consistent, and tenant-aware with full multi-organization, multi-vendor, multi-branch, multi-location, multi-currency, multi-language, and multi-unit support. Integrate this module seamlessly with inventory, invoicing, POS, procurement, reporting, and analytics, following Clean Architecture, Controller → Service → Repository pattern, SOLID/DRY/KISS principles, and long-term maintainability. Ensure full audit trails, versioned REST APIs, bulk operations, and permission-aware operations, with event-driven asynchronous workflows for non-blocking recalculations or notifications.

Refer to existing schemas, documentation, and business rules; analyze, observe, and fully understand all requirements. Implement a modular product module supporting multiple product types (inventory, service, combo, bundle, etc.) with attributes including buying price, selling price, buying discounts (flat, percentage, tiered), selling discounts (flat, percentage, tiered), and profit margins (flat, percentage, tiered). Enable dynamic addition of multiple pricing rules per product, including conditional, seasonal, or customer-specific pricing. Support item-level and total-level adjustments for discounts, VAT, taxes, coupons, and other charges, ensuring accurate transactional calculations. Ensure full integration with inventory, procurement, POS, invoicing, reporting, and analytics modules, while enforcing strict multi-tenant, multi-organization, multi-vendor, multi-branch, multi-location, multi-currency, multi-language, and multi-unit support. Follow Clean Architecture, Controller → Service → Repository pattern, and SOLID/DRY/KISS principles; implement transactional, idempotent, rollback-safe service-layer orchestration, event-driven asynchronous workflows, audit trails, versioned REST APIs, bulk operations, and permission-aware functionality to deliver a scalable, maintainable, enterprise-grade SaaS ERP platform.
